# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
The notebook "Multi-Layer Perceptron" contains the code developed for creating a MLP Neural Network manually without the use of libraries. It is a good exercise for understanding how a MLP works step by step and improve one's intuition on what this algorithm does.

The code was written by myself as partial fulfillment for the course Foundations of Data Mining at TU Eindhoven.
