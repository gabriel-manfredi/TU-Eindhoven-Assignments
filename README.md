# Foundations of Data Mining
This repository contains some of the code presented for the course Foundations of Data Mining at TU Eindhoven.
The notebook "Multi-Layer Perceptron" contains the code developed for creating a MLP Neural Network manually without the use of libraries. It is a good exercise for understanding how a MLP works step by step and improve one's intuition on what this algorithm does.
